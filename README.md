# Violet's attempts at Advent of Code 2024

Python is my primary language, so must puzzles are done in it first. This is my first time trying Advent of Code, and I wanted to use it as a way to try learning some new languages as well. For example, I started learning Rust through this. I'd like to try my hand at Haskell for some, if possible. I'm using the table below mostly for personal reference of what I've completed in which languages; I only intend on completing every puzzle in at least Python, the other languages are bonuses as far as I'm concerned.

Most days are separated by part one and two as `day[n]a.[ext]` and `day[n]b.[ext]` respectively, e.g. `day1a.py` and `day1b.py`. Since part two is only revealed after solving part one, and it usually involves a lot of modification to the original code, I like keeping them separate to run on their own. If any file happens to contain solutions to both parts, usually if its a puzzle I've already solved and am rewriting in another language, and/or the part two solution is easy to just add a variable/argument check for without much clutter, then it will be named `day[n].[ext]`, e.g. `day5.rs`. In that case, the script or binary should be able to take a single command-line argument to specify which part to solve (e.g. `./day5 a` or `./day b`).

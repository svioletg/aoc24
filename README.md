# Violet's attempts at Advent of Code 2024

Python is my primary language, so every puzzle was done in it first. This is my first time trying Advent of Code, and I wanted to use it as a way to try learning some new languages as well. For example, I started learning Rust through this. I'd like to try my hand at Haskell for some, if possible. I'm using the table below mostly for personal reference of what I've completed in which languages.
